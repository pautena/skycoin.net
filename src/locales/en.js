These nodes are substantially less expensive to produce, acquire and operate than any traditional miner used for Bitcoin or Ethereum. Obelisk was designed to be a scalable, computationally-inexpensive, zero-waste alternative to PoW.

This centralization defeats the original purpose of digital currencies.',
