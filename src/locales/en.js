      body: 'Bitcoin’s historic 100,000x run began 8 years ago. Six years ago, lead developers of Bitcoin and Ethereum quietly broke off and teamed up to begin work on a new project, Skycoin. Their goal was to perfect the blockchain technology that Satoshi introduced to the world. Why? Satoshi’s original vision of peer-to-peer cash is the reason many believe Bitcoin and Ether moved as dramatically as it did, changing our world and many lives along the way. The developers began at the core, producing Obelisk, a new consensus algorithm based on new mathematics that makes Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake completely obsolete, guaranteeing decentralization at the network level in a way no other project has before. Their new consensus algorithm, combined with their elimination of the need for mining, allowed them to solve many of the problems Bitcoin faced, and add many of the features Bitcoin was missing. Fiber, their blockchain technology, can be used to make fast, free, secure, scalable, private, fully programmable, and eco-friendly cryptocurrencies from scratch. However, their foresight showed them this wasn’t enough. Blockchain technology faced a deeper problem and a bigger threat: ISP dependence. Even if they designed the ledger perfectly built for distribution, if ISPs and governments have the ability to stop the people from distributing that ledger, Satoshi’s vision hadn’t been fulfilled. So they began looking toward building a new Internet, a wireless mesh network named Skywire. Skycoin now offers the most advanced blockchain application platform in the world, and the only platform with the possibility of ISP independence.',
